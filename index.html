        <b>Parrots,</b> also known as psittacines (<a href="">/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/</a>
        ),<sup>[1][2]</sup> are birds of the roughly 398 species<sup>[3]</sup> in
        92 genera comprising the order <b>Psittaciformes</b> (/ˈsɪtəsɪfɔːrmiːz/),
        found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The order is subdivided
        into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots), the
        Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots).
        One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with higher
        aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable
        bird group.<sup>[4]</sup> Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with
        several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere,
        as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia">Australasia</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak">bill</a>, an
        upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are
        vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit little
        or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum. They form the most
        variably sized bird order in terms of length.

    <h3>Origins and evolution</h3>
    <p>
        Psittaciform diversity in South America and Australasia suggests that the
        order may have evolved in <a href="">Gondwana</a>, centred in Australasia.<sup>[6]</sup> The
        scarcity of parrots in the fossil record, however, presents difficulties
        in confirming the hypothesis. There is currently a higher amount of fossil
        remains from the northern hemisphere in the early Cenozoic. Molecular
        studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 <a href="">million years ago</a>
        (Mya) (range 66–51 Mya) in Gondwana. The three major clades of <a href="">Neotropical
            parrots</a> originated about 50 Mya (range 57–41 Mya).
    </p>
    <p>
        A single 15 mm (0.6 in) fragment from a large lower bill (UCMP 143274),
        found in deposits from the <a href="">Lance Creek Formation</a> in Niobrara County,
        Wyoming, had been thought to be the oldest parrot fossil and is presumed
        to have originated from the Late Cretaceous period, which makes it about
        70 million years old.[9] However, other studies suggest that this fossil
        is not from a bird, but from a <a href="">caenagnathid oviraptorosaur</a> (a non-avian
        dinosaur with a birdlike beak), as several details of the fossil used to
        support its identity as a parrot are not actually exclusive to parrots,
        and it is dissimilar to the earliest-known unequivocal parrot
        fossils.<sup>[10][11]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Several fairly complete skeletons of parrot-like birds have been found in
        England and Germany. These are probably not <a href="">transitional fossils</a>
        between ancestral and modern parrots, but rather lineages that evolved
        parallel to true parrots and cockatoos:

        The earliest records of modern parrots date to around 23–20 mya. The
        fossil record—mainly from Europe—consists of bones clearly recognisable as
        belonging to anatomically modern parrots. The Southern Hemisphere
        contains no known parrot-like remains earlier than the <a href="">Early Miocene</a>
        around 20 mya. <sup>[18]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <p>
        The name 'Psittaciformes' comes from the <a href="">ancient Greek</a> for parrot,
        ψιττακός ('Psittacus'), whose origin is unclear. Ctesias (5th century BCE)
        recorded the name Psittacus after the Indian name for a bird, most likely
        a parakeet (now placed in the genus Psittacula). Pliny the Elder (23/24–79
        CE) in his Natural History (book 10, chapter 58) noted that the Indians
        called the bird as "siptaces"; however, no matching Indian name has been
        traced. <sup>[20][21]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
    <p>
        The Psittaciformes comprise three main lineages: <a href="">Strigopoidea</a>,
        <a href="">Psittacoidea</a> and <a href="Cacatuoidea"></a>. The Strigopoidea were considered part of
        the Psittacoidea, but the former is now placed at the base of the parrot
        tree next to the remaining members of the Psittacoidea, as well as all
        members of the Cacatuoidea. The Cacatuoidea are quite distinct,
        having a movable head crest, a different arrangement of the carotid
        arteries, a gall bladder, differences in the skull bones, and lack the
        Dyck texture feathers that—in the Psittacidae—scatter light to produce the
        vibrant colours of so many parrots. Colourful feathers with high levels of
        psittacofulvin resist the feather-degrading bacterium Bacillus
        licheniformis better than white ones. Lorikeets were previously
        regarded as a third family, Loriidae, but are now considered a
        tribe (Loriini) within the subfamily Loriinae, family Psittaculidae. The
        two other tribes in the subfamily are the closely related fig parrots (two
        genera in the tribe Cyclopsittini) and <a href="">budgerigar</a> (tribe
        Melopsittacini).<sup>[6][22][23]</sup>
